Were crowd control measures not in place? Palki Sharma tells you.\\n\\n--- [...] It was supposed to be a day of pure joy, of celebration and pride. Instead, Bengaluru is in shock today. I'm sure you've seen the news and the pictures. Bengaluru was all decked up for a massive celebration today. Their IPL team had finally won the tournament. The Royal Challengers beat Punjab Kings yesterday. It was their first IPL trophy in 18 years. Now the RCB fans are a very passionate lot. Plus they've been waiting for a win since 2008. So they packed the streets of Bengaluru in [...] soon the fan frenzy turned fatal. The exact details are not clear yet but reports say the rush led to a stampede. At least 11 people were killed, including children, and more than 30 were injured. Like I said, the exact sequence of events is unclear, but these pictures give you an idea. Uh you can see fans climbing up fences and trees. In some places, the police pushed back with force. We will show you the pictures, but as always, viewer discretion is advised.
