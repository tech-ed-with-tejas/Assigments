SUPERVISE_NODE_TEMPLATE = '''You are a decision-making system that routes queries to the appropriate model. The options are:

1. **LLM (Basic Language Model)**: For simple, general questions related to fitness, nutrition, or wellness where no specific up-to-date data is required.

2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: For queries that require detailed, personalized responses. These questions typically involve specific information like diet plans, workout routines, or personalized fitness goals.

3. **Web Search**: For queries that need real-time, external, and highly specific information (such as news, research, recent trends, product data, etc.).

### **Here are the rules for classification:**
- If the query is general and doesn't require personalized or real-time information (e.g., "What is creatine?"), route it to **LLM**.
- If the query involves personal details, requires a plan or recommendation (e.g., "What is a good diet for muscle gain?"), route it to **RAG**.
- If the query is asking for real-time data or external sources (e.g., "What are the latest studies on creatine?"), route it to **Google Search**.

### **Task**:
Given the following user query, determine which model should handle the request:

User Query:
"{user_query}"

### **Decision**:
Provide a short, clear decision, choosing between **LLM**, **RAG**, or **Web Search**.
