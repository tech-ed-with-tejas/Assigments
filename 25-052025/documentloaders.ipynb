Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\\ni , KW K\\ni , V W V\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W K\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W V\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dv\\nand W O ∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO(n2 · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(1)\\nRecurrent\\nO(n · d2)\\nO(n)\\nO(n)\\nConvolutional\\nO(k · n · d2)\\nO(1)\\nO(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO(r · n · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(n/r)\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7\\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU\\nTraining Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nByteNet [18]\\n23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39]\\n39.2\\n1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38]\\n24.6\\n39.92\\n2.3 · 1019\\n1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9]\\n25.16\\n40.46\\n9.6 · 1018\\n1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32]\\n26.03\\n40.56\\n2.0 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39]\\n40.4\\n8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38]\\n26.30\\n41.16\\n1.8 · 1020\\n1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9]\\n26.36\\n41.29\\n7.7 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model)\\n27.3\\n38.1\\n3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big)\\n28.4\\n41.8\\n2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6\\nResults\\n6.1\\nMachine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2\\nModel Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8\\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\\n9\\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23\\nof WSJ)\\nParser\\nTraining\\nWSJ 23 F1\\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century. Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906, and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.\\nComputers were needed to go beyond Markov chains. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.\\nThe terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning, used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal. Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a \"relatively mature\" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use, process plans for manufacturing and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative neural nets (2014-2019) ===\\n\\nSince inception, the field of machine learning has used both discriminative models and generative models to model and predict data. Beginning in the late 2000s, the emergence of deep learning drove progress, and research in image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing and other tasks. Neural networks in this era were typically trained as discriminative models due to the difficulty of generative modeling.\\nIn 2014, advancements such as the variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network produced the first practical deep neural networks capable of learning generative models, as opposed to discriminative ones, for complex data such as images. These deep generative models were the first to output not only class labels for images but also entire images.\\nIn 2017, the Transformer network enabled advancements in generative models compared to older Long-Short Term Memory models, leading to the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), known as GPT-1, in 2018. This was followed in 2019 by GPT-2, which demonstrated the ability to generalize unsupervised to many different tasks as a '), Document(metadata={'title': 'Generative AI pornography', 'summary': 'Generative AI pornography or simply AI pornography is a digitally created pornography produced through generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.

This trend accelerated in 2022 with Stability AI\\'s release of Stable Diffusion (SD), an open-source text-to-image model that enables users to generate images, including NSFW content, from text prompts using the LAION-Aesthetics subset of the LAION-5B dataset. Despite Stability AI\\'s warnings against sexual imagery, SD\\'s public release led to dedicated communities exploring both artistic and explicit content, sparking ethical debates over open-access AI and its use in adult media. By 2020, AI tools had advanced to generate highly realistic adult content, amplifying calls for regulation.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated influencers ===\\nOne application of generative AI technology is the creation of AI-generated influencers on platforms such as OnlyFans and Instagram. These AI personas interact with users in ways that can mimic real human engagement, offering an entirely synthetic but convincing experience. While popular among niche audiences, these virtual influencers have prompted discussions about authenticity, consent, and the blurring line between human and AI-generated content, especially in adult entertainment.\\n\\n\\n=== The growth of AI porn sites ===\\nBy 2023, websites dedicated to AI-generated adult content had gained traction, catering to audiences seeking customizable experiences. These platforms allow users to create or view AI-generated pornography tailored to their preferences. These platforms enable users to create or view AI-generated adult content appealing to different preferences through prompts and tags, customizing body type, facial features, and art styles. Tags further refine the output, creating niche and diverse content. Many sites feature extensive image libraries and continuous content feeds, combining personalization with discovery and enhancing user engagement. AI porn sites, therefore, attract those seeking unique or niche experiences, sparking debates on creativity and the ethical boundaries of AI in adult media.\\n\\n\\n== Ethical concerns and misuse ==\\nThe growth of generative AI pornography has also attracted some cause for criticism. AI technology can be exploited to create non-consensual pornographic material, posing risks similar to those seen with deepfake revenge porn and AI-generated NCII (Non-Consensual Intimate Image). A 2023 analysis found that 98% of deepfake videos online are pornographic, with 99% of the victims being women. Some famous celebrities victims of deepfake include Scarlett Johansson, Taylor Swift, and Maisie Williams.\\nOpenAI is exploring whether NSFW content, such as erotica, can be responsibly generated in age-appropriate contexts while maintaining its ban on deepfakes. This proposal has attracted criticism from child safety campaigners who argue it undermines OpenAI\\'s mission to develop \"safe and beneficial\" AI. Additionally, the Internet Watch Foundation has raised concerns about AI being used to generate sexual abuse content involving children.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery (AI Undress) ===\\nSeveral US states are taking actions against using deepfake apps and sharing them on the internet. In 2024, San Francisco filed a landmark lawsuit to shut down \"undress\" apps that allow users to generate non-consensual AI nude images, citing violations of state laws.

This period is sometimes referred to as an AI spring, to contrast it with previous AI winters.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nIn 2012, a University of Toronto research team used artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques to lower the error rate below 25% for the first time during the ImageNet challenge for object recognition in computer vision. The event catalyzed the AI boom later that decade, when many alumni of the ImageNet challenge became leaders in the tech industry. In March 2016, AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in a five-game match, marking the first time a computer Go program had beaten a 9-dan professional without handicap. This match led to significant increase in public interest in AI. The generative AI race began in earnest in 2016 or 2017 following the founding of OpenAI and earlier advances made in graphical processing units (GPUs), the amount and quality of training data, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models and transformer architectures. \\nIn 2018, the Artificial Intelligence Index, an initiative from Stanford University, reported a global explosion of commercial and research efforts in AI. Europe published the largest number of papers in the field that year, followed by China and North America. Technologies such as AlphaFold led to more accurate predictions of protein folding and improved the process of drug development. Economists and lawmakers began to discuss the potential impact of AI more frequently. By 2022, large language models (LLMs) saw increased usage in chatbot applications; text-to-image-models could generate images that appeared to be human-made; and speech synthesis software was able to replicate human speech efficiently.\\nAccording to metrics from 2017 to 2021, the United States outranks the rest of the world in terms of venture capital funding, the number of startups, and patents granted in AI. Scientists who have immigrated to the U.S. play an outsized role in the country\\'s development of AI technology. Many of them were educated in China, prompting debates about national security concerns amid worsening relations between the two countries.\\nExperts have framed AI development as a competition for economic and geopolitical advantage between the United States and China. In 2021, an analyst for the Council on Foreign Relations outlined ways that the U.S. could maintain its position amid progress made by China. In 2023, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies advocated for the U.S. to use its dominance in AI technology to drive its foreign policy instead of relying on trade agreements.\\n\\n\\n== Advances ==\\n\\n\\n=== Biomedical ===\\nThe AlphaFold 2 score of more than 90 in CASP\\'s global distance test (GDT) is considered a significant achievement in computational biology and great progress towards a decades-old grand challenge of biology. The structural biologist and Nobel Prize winner Venki Ramakrishnan called the result \"a stunning advance on the protein folding problem\", adding that \"It has occurred decades before many people in the field would have predicted.\"\\nThe ability to predict protein structures accurately based on the constituent amino acid sequence is expected to accelerate drug discovery and enable a better understanding of diseases.\\n\\n\\n=== Images and videos ===\\n\\nText-to-image models captured widespread public attention when OpenAI announced DALL-E, a transformer system, in January 2021. A successor capable of generating complex and realistic images, DALL-E 2, was unveiled in April 2022. An alternative text-to-image model, Midjourney, was released in July 2022.

It was originally used as a form of semi-supervised learning, as the model is trained first on an unlabeled dataset (pretraining step) by learning to generate datapoints in the dataset, and then it is trained to classify a labeled dataset. \\nThere were three main types of early GP. The hidden Markov models learn a generative model of sequences for downstream applications. For example, in speech recognition, a trained HMM infers the most likely hidden sequence for a speech signal, and the hidden sequence is taken as the phonemes of the speech signal. These were developed in the 1970s and became widely applied in speech recognition in the 1980s.\\nThe compressors learn to compress data such as images and textual sequences, and the compressed data serves as a good representation for downstream applications such as facial recognition. The autoencoders similarly learn a latent representation of data for later downstream applications such as speech recognition. The connection between autoencoders and algorithmic compressors was noted in 1993.\\n\\nDuring the 2010s, the problem of machine translation was solved by recurrent neural networks, with attention mechanism added. This was optimized into the transformer architecture, published by Google researchers in Attention Is All You Need (2017). That development led to the emergence of large language models such as BERT (2018) which was a pre-trained transformer (PT) but not designed to be generative (BERT was an \"encoder-only\" model). Also in 2018, OpenAI published Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training, which introduced GPT-1, the first in its GPT series.\\nPreviously in 2017, some of the authors who would later work on GPT-1 worked on generative pre-training of language with LSTM, which resulted in a model that could represent text with vectors that could easily be fine-tuned for downstream applications.\\nPrior to transformer-based architectures, the best-performing neural NLP (natural language processing) models commonly employed supervised learning from large amounts of manually-labeled data. The reliance on supervised learning limited their use on datasets that were not well-annotated, and also made it prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to train extremely large language models.\\nThe semi-supervised approach OpenAI employed to make a large-scale generative system—and was first to do with a transformer m')]\n"

(Applause.)  Wow.  Thank you very, very much.\\n\\nVice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens, the golden age of America begins right now.  (Applause.)\\n\\nFrom this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.  We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer.  During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.  (Applause.)\\n\\nOur sovereignty will be reclaimed.  Our safety will be restored.  The scales of justice will be rebalanced.  The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAmerica will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.  (Applause.)\\n\\nI return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success.  A tide of change is sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.\\n\\nBut first, we must be honest about the challenges we face.  While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.\\n\\nAs we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust.  For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.\\n\\nWe now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while, at the same time, stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad.\\n\\nIt fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.\\n\\nWe have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people.\\n\\nOur country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina — who have been treated so badly — (applause) — and other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago or, more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense.  They’re raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country — some of whom are sitting here right now.  They don’t have a home any longer.  That’s interesting.  But we can’t let this happen.  Everyone is unable to do anything about it.  That’s going to change.\\n\\nWe have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.\\n\\nAnd we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves — in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them.  All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.  (Applause.)\\n\\nMy recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and, indeed, their freedom.  From this moment on, America’s decline is over.  (Applause.)\\n\\nOur liberties and our nation’s glorious destiny will no longer be denied.  And we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America’s government.\\n\\nOver the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I’ve learned a lot along the way.\\n\\nThe journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one — that, I can tell you.  Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.\\n\\nJust a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin’s bullet ripped through my ear.  But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason.  I was saved by God to make America great again.  (Applause.)\\n\\nThank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\\n\\nThank you very much.  (Applause.)\\n\\nThat is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength.  We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.\\n\\nFor American citizens, January 20th, 2025, is Liberation Day.  (Applause.)  It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country.\\n\\nAs our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural.  And very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states — (applause) — and the popular vote, we won by millions of people.  (Applause.)\\n\\nTo the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote.  We set records, and I will not forget it.  I’ve heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.\\n\\nToday is Martin Luther King Day.  And his honor — this will be a great honor.  But in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality.  We will make his dream come true.  (Applause.)\\n\\nThank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\\n\\nNational unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before.  In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success.  We will not forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God.  Can’t do that.  (Applause.)\\n\\nToday, I will sign a series of historic executive orders.  With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.  It’s all about common sense.  (Applause.)\\n\\nFirst, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAll illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.  We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy.  (Applause.)\\n\\nI will end the practice of catch and release.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.  (Applause.)\\n\\nUnder the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAs commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do.  We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\\n\\nNext, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.  (Applause.)\\n\\nThe inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency.  We will drill, baby, drill.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAmerica will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have — the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth — and we are going to use it.  We’ll use it.  (Applause.)\\n\\nWe will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world.  (Applause.)\\n\\nWe will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.\\n\\nWith my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal, and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers.  (Applause.)\\n\\nIn other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.\\n\\nWe will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago.  And thank you to the autoworkers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence.  We did tremendously with their vote.  (Applause.)\\n\\nI will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families.  Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.  (Applause.)\\n\\nFor this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues.  It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources.\\n\\nThe American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.\\n\\nTo restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAfter years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I also will sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America.  (Applause.)\\n\\nNever again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents — something I know something about.  (Laughter.)  We will not allow that to happen.  It will not happen again.\\n\\nUnder my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.  (Applause.)\\n\\nThis week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.  (Applause.)  We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAs of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.  (Applause.)\\n\\nThis week, I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full back pay.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty.  It’s going to end immediately.  (Applause.)  Our armed forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating America’s enemies.  (Applause.)\\n\\nLike in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen.  We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end — and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.  (Applause.)\\n\\nMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.  That’s what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier.\\n\\nI’m pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.  (Applause.)\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nAmerica will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world.\\n\\nA short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America — (applause) — and we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs.  (Applause.)\\n\\nPresident McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent — he was a natural businessman — and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United Spates — the United States — I mean, think of this — spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.\\n\\nWe have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama’s promise to us has been broken.\\n\\nThe purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated.  American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form.  And that includes the United States Navy.\\n\\nAnd above all, China is operating the Panama Canal.  And we didn’t give it to China.  We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAbove all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history’s greatest civilization.\\n\\nSo, as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success.  We will not be deterred.  Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.\\n\\nThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation — one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.\\n\\nAnd we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAmbition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other.  There’s no nation like our nation.\\n\\nAmericans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers.  The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts.  The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls.\\n\\nOur American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth.  No one comes close.\\n\\nAmericans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness.  They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand.  If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.\\n\\nMany people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback.  But as you see today, here I am.  The American people have spoken.  (Applause.)\\n\\nI stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do.  In America, the impossible is what we do best.  (Applause.)\\n\\nFrom New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\\n\\nThey were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.\\n\\nTogether, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.\\n\\nAfter all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history.  With your help, we will restore America promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love — and we love it so much.\\n\\nWe are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.  So, to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.  We’re going to win like never before.  (Applause.)\\n\\nThank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\\n\\nThank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\\n\\nIn recent years, our nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before.\\n\\nWe will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism.  Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.\\n\\nAmerica will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and goodwill.  We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before.\\n\\nWe will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail.  From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign, and independent nation.\\n\\nWe will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans.  The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun.\\n\\nThank you.  God bless America.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\\n\\nThank you.  (Applause.)\\n\\nEND  12:40 P.M. EST')]"

Management of hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS \\n• Recognize severe hypoxemic respiratory failure when a patient with respiratory distress is \\nfailing standard oxygen therapy. Patients may continue to have increased work of breathing or \\nhypoxemia even when oxygen is delivered via a face mask with reservoir bag (flow rates of  \\n10-15 L/min, which is typically the minimum flow required to maintain bag inflation; FiO 2 \\n0.60-0.95). Hypoxemic respiratory failure in ARDS commonly results from intrapulmonary \\nventilation-perfusion mismatch or shunt and usually requires mechanical ventilation. \\n• High – flow nasal catheter oxygenation or non – invasive mechanical ventilation: When \\nrespiratory distress and/or hypoxemia of the patient cannot be alleviated after receiving  \\nstandard oxygen therapy, high – flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy or non – invasive \\nventilation can be considered. If conditions do not improve or even get worse within a short \\ntime (1 – 2 hours), tracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should be used in a \\ntimely manner. Compared to standard oxygen therapy, HFNO reduces the need for intubation. \\nPatients with hypercapnia (exacerbation of obstructive lung disease, cardiogenic pulmonary \\noedema), hemodynamic instability, multi -organ failure, or  abnormal mental status should \\ngenerally not receive HFNO, although emerging data suggest that HFNO may be safe in \\npatients with mild -moderate and non -worsening hypercapnia 25. Patients receiving HFNO \\nshould be in a monitored setting and cared for by experi enced personnel capable of \\nendotracheal intubation in case the patient acutely deteriorates or does not improve after a short \\ntrial (about 1 hr). \\n• NIV guidelines make no recommendation on use in hypoxemic respiratory failure (apart from \\ncardiogenic pulmonar y oedema and post -operative respiratory failure) or pandemic viral \\nillness (referring to studies of SARS and pandemic influenza). Risks include delayed \\nintubation, large tidal volumes, and injurious transpulmonary pressures. Limited data suggest \\na high failure rate when MERS patients received NIV. Patients receiving a trial of NIV should \\nbe in a monitored setting and cared for by experienced personnel capable of endotracheal \\nintubation in case the patient acutely deteriorates or does not improve after a short trial (about \\n1 hr).

Patients with ARDS, especially young children or those who are obese \\nor pregnant, may de -saturate quickly during intubation. Pre -oxygenate with 100% FiO 2 for 5 \\nminutes, via a face mask with reservoir bag, bag-valve mask, HFNO, or NIV. Rapid sequence \\nintubation is appropriate after an airway assessment that ide ntifies no signs of difficult \\nintubation. \\n• Implement mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4 –8 ml/kg predicted body  \\nweight, PBW) and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure <30 cmH2O). This is a strong \\nrecommendation from a clinical guidel ine for patients with ARDS, and is suggested for \\npatients with sepsis-induced respiratory failure. The initial tidal volume is 6 ml/kg PBW; tidal \\nvolume up to 8 ml/kg PBW is allowed if undesirable side effects occur (e.g. dyssynchrony, pH \\n<7.15). Hypercapnia is permitted if meeting the pH goal of 7.30-7.45. Ventilator protocols are \\navailable. The use of deep sedation may be required to control respiratory drive and achieve \\ntidal volume targets. \\n• In patients with severe ARDS, prone ventilation for >12 hours p er day is recommended. \\nApplication of prone ventilation is strongly recommended for adult and paediatric patients with \\nsevere ARDS but requires sufficient human resources and expertise to be performed safely. \\n• Use a conservative fluid management strategy fo r ARDS patients without tissue \\nhypoperfusion. \\n• In patients with moderate or severe ARDS, higher PEEP instead of lower PEEP is \\nsuggested.PEEP titration requires consideration of benefits (reducing atelectrauma and \\nimproving alveolar recruitment) vs. risks (end-inspiratory overdistension leading to lung injury \\nand higher pulmonary vascular resistance).

The use \\nof central venous and arterial catheters should be based on resource availability and individual \\npatient needs. Detailed guidelines are availab le for the management of septic shock in adults \\nand children. \\n• In resuscitation from septic shock in adults, give at least 30 ml/kg of isotonic crystalloid in \\nadults in the first 3 hours. In resuscitation from septic shock in children in well -resourced \\nsettings, give 20 ml/kg as a rapid bolus and up to 40 -60 ml/kg in the first 1 hr. Do not use \\nhypotonic crystalloids, starches, or gelatins for resuscitation. \\n• Fluid resuscitation may lead to volume overload, including respiratory failure. If there is no \\nresponse to fluid loading and signs of volume overload appear (for example, jugular venous \\ndistension, crackles on lung auscultation, pulmonary oedema on imaging, or hepatomegaly in \\nchildren), then reduce or discontinue fluid administration.
